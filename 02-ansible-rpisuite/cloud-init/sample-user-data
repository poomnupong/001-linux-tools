#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# Usage for Raspberry Pi 4 polarbear cluster
# - read throug this file and populate your parameters: ssh pubkeys, custom management users
# - save this file as 'user-data' and copy it to system-boot partition of the sd card
# - or alternative inject this file into the image. This require a linux machine or VM and the use of partx command to mount first vfat partition
